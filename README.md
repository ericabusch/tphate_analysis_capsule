T-PHATE manifold learning of brain state dynamics
This is a code capsule comprising all scripts needed to replicate the analyses in "Multi-view manifold learning of human brain state trajectories" (Busch et al., 2022, [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.03.490534v3)). In this paper, we present T-PHATE (temporal potential of heat diffusion for affinity-based transition embedding), a novel multi-view manifold learning algorithm. We demonstrate how T-PHATE learns meaningful low-dimensional representations of neural data that can be used to track static and dynamic properties of brain states during multiple fMRI tasks. We benchmark T-PHATE against 6 of the most commonly used dimensionality reduction methods in biomedical sciences, as well as 2 alternative implementations of T-PHATE, and the full, high-dimensional representation. Through denoising brain data in both space and time, T-PHATE yields a latent structure in fMRI data that better represents static and dynamic information and corresponds with human behavior, allowing enhanced access at the neural signatures of higher-order cognition.  

Since the data needed to replicate all analyses entirely are too large to upload and share on this platform, and would take too long to run without HPC access and substantial parallelization, we provide demo data to replicate analyses for a single dataset, region of interest, and embedding algorithm (T-PHATE). One can run all analyses for the demo data by including "demo" as the final command-line argument for each of the scripts.
